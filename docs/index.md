## The many reasons for switching to Linux

### Don't pay $200 for your operating system.

You're probably saying to yourself: "Oh, I didn't pay for Windows". Are you absolutely sure? If your computer came with a copy of Windows, then you paid for it, even if the store didn't tell you. On average, the price of a Windows license is about a quarter of the price of a new computer. Where do you think Microsoft gets its money from?

Or, if you build your own PC and buy your individual hardware components, you will find that a new Windows 11 key costs about $140 for the Home Edition and $260 for the Pro version on the Microsoft website.

On the other hand, you can get Linux for free. That's right, all these guys all around the world have worked very hard to make a clean, secure, efficient, good-looking system, and they're giving their work away so that everyone can use it for free. Of course, some companies make a good business out of selling support, documentation, hotline, etc. for their own version of Linux, and that is certainly a good thing. But most of the time, you don't have to pay a cent.

### No more crapware

If you've ever bought a new computer running Windows, you must know that it can be a very frustrating experience.

It all starts the first time you turn it on: countless windows pop up asking you to subscribe to services, the premium version of an antivirus, games you never asked for, productivity applications that require you to create an online account, and so on.

But it doesn't stop there. Every time you start your computer, all these pre-installed programs start up in the background, and you have to wait longer and longer to see your desktop on the screen, and when you finally do so, it feels too slow to use because all these programs are running in the background.

To add insult to injury, often after you have owned your new computer for 30 days, new dialogs start popping up and you realize that some of the programs you thought were free (antivirus, for example) really aren't, all you have is a free 30-day trial.

The thing is, most computer manufacturers think this is a good thing. They install programs on your computer before you buy it, because they think it will improve your experience, because it will give you "more" for the same price, and because they think it will help differentiate them from competitors, who may not offer as many "improvements" over the standard system. For them, this is added value.

But for the user, it usually means more pain, more waiting, more uninstalling of unwanted programs, more money to pay if you decide you do need that not-so-free antivirus, and at the end of the day, a bloated and crippled computer. That's why these programs have been given a not-so-polite name: "crapware".

None of that with Linux. No program will nag you to subscribe, pay after a trial period is over, or just slow down your computer and make you wait some more while it boots up, just when you thought it was ready to use. Linux comes with everything that you need to start working right out of the box, but without the crapware.

### Freedom!

Linux and open source software in general is _free_. This means that its license is a _free license_, and the most common one is the _General Public License (GPL)_. This license says that anyone is allowed to copy the software, see the source code (the "recipe"), modify it, and redistribute it as long as it remains licensed under the GPL.

So what do you care about freedom? Imagine that Microsoft disappearing tomorrow (okay, that's not very likely, but what about in 5 years, 10 years?). Or imagine that they suddenly tripled the price of a Windows or Office license. If you're locked into Windows, there's nothing you can do. You (or your business) depend on this one company, on their software, and you can't possibly make things work without it (What good is a computer without an operating system?).

Isn't that a serious problem? You depend on a single company and trust them wholeheartedly to keep something as important as your computers running the way they should in these days. If Microsoft decides to move Windows to a paid subscription model, there's nothing you can do about it (except switch to Linux, of course). If Windows has a bug that really bothers you, and Microsoft won't fix it, there's nothing you can do about it. If a new version of Windows doesn't support your hardware anymore, there's nothing you can do about it.

With open source, when a particular project or sponsoring company dies, all the code remains open to the community and people can continue to improve it. If this project is particulary useful to you, you can even do this yourself. If a particular bug annoys you, you can report it, talk to the developers, but even better, you can fix it yourself (or hire someone to do so), and send the changes back to the upstream developers so that everyone gets the improvement as well. You're free to do (almost) anything you want with the software.

## The many reasons for switching to Linux

### Don't pay $200 for your operating system.

You're probably saying to yourself: "Oh, I didn't pay for Windows". Are you absolutely sure? If your computer came with a copy of Windows, then you paid for it, even if the store didn't tell you. On average, the price of a Windows license is about a quarter of the price of a new computer. Where do you think Microsoft gets its money from?

Or, if you build your own PC and buy your individual hardware components, you will find that a new Windows 11 key costs about $140 for the Home Edition and $260 for the Pro version on the Microsoft website.

On the other hand, you can get Linux for free. That's right, all these guys all around the world have worked very hard to make a clean, secure, efficient, good-looking system, and they're giving their work away so that everyone can use it for free. Of course, some companies make a good business out of selling support, documentation, hotline, etc. for their own version of Linux, and that is certainly a good thing. But most of the time, you don't have to pay a cent.
